            <h2>His Childhood</h2>
            <p>Vincent Willem van Gogh was born on <b>30 March 1853</b> in <em>Nertherlands</em>.
               He was the oldesst surviving child of Theodorus and Anna Cornelia.
               He had a really common name. Van Gogh was a serious and thoughtful child.
               He was homeschooled for a while and then sent to the village school later.
               His interest in art began at a young age. He was encouraged to draw as a child by his mother. 
               From making expressive paintings in his early days to making intense painting in his later years,
               van Gogh had a lot of influence in the fiEld of Art and expression.

            <h2>Artistic Breakthrough</h2>
            <p>Ill from drink and suffering from smoker's cough, in February 1888 Van Gogh sought refuge in <em>Arles</em>.
            The time in Arles became one of Van Gogh's more prolific periods: he completed <b>200 paintings</b> and more than <b>100 drawings and watercolours</b>
            He had thoughts of finding an Art colony.He was enchanted by the local countryside and light; his works from this period are rich in <em>yellow</em>, <em>ultramarine</em> and <em>mauve</em>.
            They include harvests, wheat fields and general rural landmarks from the area.In March 1888 he painted landscapes using a gridded "perspective frame".
            He wanted a gallery to display his work and started a series of paintings that eventually included <em>van Gogh's Chair</em>, <em>Bedroom in Arles</em>, <em>The Night Cafe</em>, <em>Cafe Terrace at Night</em>,
            <em>Starry Night Over the Rhone</em> and <em>Still life: Vase with Twelve Sunflowers</em>.
            Van Gogh wrote that with <em>The Night Café</em> he tried "to express the idea that the café is a place where one can ruin oneself, go mad, or commit a crime"
